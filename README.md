## üèà Tampa Bay Buccaneers 2024-2025 Season Forecasting

### Project Overview:
In this project, I developed machine learning models to predict player performance for the 2024-2025 NFL season, specifically focusing on key metrics like receptions, yards, and touchdowns. By analyzing historical data from sources like NFL Next Gen Stats, I was able to forecast key players' contributions and overall team performance.

**Tools & Techniques:**
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Key Insights:**
- Forecasted metrics for players such as Mike Evans and Chris Godwin, providing insights into game strategy for the upcoming season.
- Developed visual dashboards comparing player performance across NFC South teams.
